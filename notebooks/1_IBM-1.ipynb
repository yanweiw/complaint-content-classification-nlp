According to Wells Fargo they said i let my insurance lap! But it did not it auto renewed. From that day forward I have been emailing wells Fargo to not escrow my insurance. They continue to do it! I pay my own homeowners ' insurance. I don't need them to escrow my insurance. This is a XX/XX/XXXX loan They are escrowing on the 20 % part of the lone the 80 % part of the loan is with another mortgage company who also escrow homeowners ' insurance. Finally, the other mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX services. stopped escrowing my account at my request. Which Wells Fargo fail to do. This is unheard of especially on this small loan amount. I have written many letters and calls to Wells Fargo no avail its failing on deaf ears. There was never a lap in my homeowners ' insurance. Several time they even put XXXX Lenders place insurance on my account before they started escrowing my account. my mortgage went from XXXX to over XXXX a month because Wells Fargo over escrow account and the amount they have me paying. I am making double payments, XXXX with Wells Fargo and XXXX insurance company which I have my policy through.\n",

My ex husband and I was on a loan together. I filed for divorce and the home was granted to me as alimony in solido. I sent that to Wells Fargo. An escrow check was issued afterwards. I was asked to in order to reissue the check in only my name I needed to get him to write a letter stating that he no longer has interest in the property. I did. It didn't last long because sometime after another check was issued. I called back, then they tell me that I need a Quit Claim Deed signed by him in order to have future checks to only be issued in my name. I had to contact him to get that done, nw mind you I've remarried by this time. I bit the bullet and got that done and submitted. Over the years when a check is issued I've had to call in and resend the same documents that I've sent over 20 times to them. In XXXX I sold the home, without having his signature of course because of the Quit Claim Deed being filed. This week ( XXXX ) I received another check from them mishandling the loan modification in which case I didn't need his signature to apply for that, but I'm being asked to get him to sign another letter. This is ridiculous! The Quit Claim Deed according to my attorney automatically dissolve his interest. They are holding my funds due to me illegally. I am exhausted dealing with these people who willy nilly changes their rules at will. This is something I should no longer have to do. This is my money and they are making it difficult for me to have it. Something needs to be done about this. So per my attorney I am filing a formal complaint for this to be investigated and set right for me.\n",

This one is the XXXX harassment and neglect to credit my insurance since XXXX. I need Wells to correct this, pay interest and penalties sufficient to discourage Wells from continuing practices that continuously damaged me for the past several years. Despite 2 open cases and several attempts to correct your mistakes and inactions {$1000.00}, along with other interest and payments taken by Wells Fargo to destroy my credit and ability to maintain a correct credit score. I will be forced to follow up this demand with court action, and to reopen prior complaints made in XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and now XXXX. It appears these actions by Wells Fargo are deliberate, vindictive, or at a level of gross negligence to such a point that Wells Fargo should not be allowed to be licensed to continue business in the state of CA or elsewhere in the USA.

So I keep getting letters from Wells Fargo Bank stating my case was settled. Which is not true. I am not getting any explanation about the forbearance being placed on our credit report which has affected our ability to purchase anything without getting a higher rate loan. This not fair for us. I am attaching copies of the documents that we received from Wells Fargo Bank stating that they made errors in their calculation of our accounts.\n",

Wells Fargo only offered XXXX option which doubled my mortgage yet they stated this was the only option. The payments were to begin in XXXX. I made the XXXX mortgage payments in XXXX which have to be made separately on XXXX different days. In spite of the arrangement being made on XX/XX/XXXX, Wells Fargo proceeded to initiate foreclosure proceedings ILLEGALLY and WITHOUT proper and legal process service. I wasnt aware of this, as XXXX XXXX notified. In XXXX I received a letter in the mail regarding a FINAL hearing on my home. I contacted HUD and the courts and filed a complaint with CFPB after failing to get any information from Wells Fargo. A representative from HUD contacted me regarding my mortgage. He sent a follow up email stating that he spoke with Wells Fargo and informed me that I needed to call and apply for a loan modification with partial claim and that this would bring the loan current. I contacted Wells Fargo and was told there is no such thing yet I proceeded with the application process in hopes that Wells Fargo would consider my account for any and all options. XXXX at Wells Fargo contacted me and I provided CFPB with recordings of the calls. Although Wells Fargo stated to HUD that I would be considered for XXXX Recovery Modification with a Partial Claim, they told me the opposite and my mortgage was not considered for the loan modification. Once again, the only offer made was for me to pay double my monthly mortgage and I can not afford that. I have emailed Wells Fargo to ask about a forbearance as Ive never received XXXX, and to date they havent responded. In my last complaint I stated the following : XXXX. Wells Fargo mortgage practices are discriminatory. They have committed more than XXXX illegal act however they refuse to correct the issue for example the lack of leg service process, their outright refusal to provide loan modification options that are offered to others. XXXX. Ive asked Wells Fargo to remedy these grievances to which they continue to produce fraudulent outlandish documents and say that they have mailed them to me however I received nothing from Wells Fargo. After being spoken to you in a very disrespectful and derogatory I requested that Wells Fargo not call me unless There is a mediator to ensure that they will conduct themselves in a professional fashion. I have emailed Wells Fargo several times and they have yet to respond. I allowed enough time to lapse as to ensure that the complaint is not seen as frivolous or insubstantial. I have yet to receive a email from Wells Fargo regarding the application or the request for mortgage assistance. \\n\\nWells Fargo has not attempted to contact me at all. I submitted proof that I contacted them several times, written proof, yet they have not done the same. Wells Fargo has fabricated evidence to attempt to prove that they have worked with me yet they haven't. I will contact them again, via email, so that I have written proof of all of the complaints and the fact that they have refused to work with me.\n",

The mortgage was set on auto-payment from the bank. Starting in XXXX Wells Fargo had issues processing the payment on their end. The money was successfully taken from our account and the transfer showed as success from our bank, however, Wells Fargo wasn't showing the money as paid. Each month we had to call to resolve it and they assured it was taken care of. In XXXX, they incorrectly opened a foreclosure on our house. The house was sent to public auction. Wells Fargo rescinded the foreclosure and sales notice because they admitted the error was 100 % on their end and our mortgage was and has always been in good standing. Now, in XX/XX/XXXX, they incorrectly opened another foreclosure and they have assured us it is rescinded, but we have yet to receive any documentation confirming the rescission. See timeline of this year below. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX : XXXX - We received a letter from Wells Fargo stating we had been removed from the mortgage assistance review program. The mortgage was paid on time as it has been every month so we were confused. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - Called Wells Fargo to ask about the letter. They said it was sent it error due to the incorrect foreclosure that occurred in XXXX and that we should disregard. Verified recent payment was processed correctly and online account in good standing. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - Received a letter attached to our door from a lawyer who offered to help us on the recent foreclosure opened. No contact yet from Wells Fargo Called Wells Fargo and they said a foreclosure was incorrectly opened on our house and they were going to rescind it immediately. They were also going to send certified letters to all three credit bureaus and to us stating the foreclosure and late payments were in error. \\n\\nXX/XX/XXXX - Called Wells Fargo to ask about the foreclosure retraction and the certified letters. They said to expect it early the next week. \\n\\nWe have continued to call Wells Fargo and they keep saying the letters are \" on their way '' or \" processing '' Harm Done : -Having XXXX incorrect foreclosures has had a severe negative impact. Currently we each saw a drop of more than XXXX points on our credit scores. In addition, we have people coming to our house looking to buy it at action or assist us with our mortgage. We receive about XXXX calls per day from load officers and lawyers offering assistance.\n",
       "121    Response to Wells Fargo regarding complaint number XXXX I responded with this and have heard nothing back from Wells Fargo Therefore, I have submitted a new complaint with my response. Their answers to the above complaints are not adequate and I request that they strongly look into the below as well as the penalties for their violations. The penalties are clearly stated, and I am unsure of how they came up with XXXX? ... They also neglected to order my appraisal, blamed me for it, and then made me cover the cost. Youd think that after their mistake, they would have the decency to waive the appraisal fee. Wells Fargo is well aware that my loan officer was responsible for managing and communicating about this, yet they refuse to accept any responsibility. Please see below : Delay with initial disclosures : I am glad that after months Wells Fargo has finally acknowledged that their Loan Officer, XXXX XXXX broke TRID regulations. Its important to state that it isnt just that it was not issued in a timely manner, it was issued outside of what the federal guidelines mandate. Furthermore, I spoke to Amys supervisor and had Wells Fargo conduct two prior investigations that failed to acknowledge this causing me an extreme amount of wasted time, stress and energy. The information presented to Wells Fargo never changed yet their explanation did from person to person. It is unreasonable that a person must dedicate this much time and energy to have their legitimate claims acknowledged and I believe it is purposely done this way in the hopes that people give up. There are penalties for violating TRID regulations that Wells Fargo is responsible for. \\nConcerns regarding appraisal order : As a licensed loan officer, XXXX XXXX was responsible for informing me about the appraisal process, including how payment should be handled. It's reasonable to say that every loan officer has this conversation with their clients. However, XXXX did not discuss the appraisal at all with me because she forgot to do so and not because there was documentation on some notice in the online portal. Throughout the months, there were numerous emails exchanged between myself and XXXX regarding documents they needed from me, but the topic of an appraisal never was mentioned. We always used emails to communicate not the portal as the online portal is overwhelming and confusing. It is not my job to bring the appraisal to XXXX ( even though ultimately that is what happened ), rather her job to bring it to me regardless of the portal system. Wells Fargo 's refusal to take responsibility for the delay in ordering the appraisal is unacceptable. The job of all Loan officers is to discuss appraisals with their clients, and XXXX 's failure to do so made me feel unfairly treated compared to her other clients, which I consider discriminatory. I would also like to note that when speaking to more than XXXX employee at Wells Fargo they stated it was unusual and out of practice for something like this to occur and that appraisals are always ordered within the first week or XXXX. \\nMy appraisal not being ordered was not because of fault of my own, it was it a direct result of my loan officers negligence and Wells Fargo continues to not take accountability for this. Despite acknowledging that this should not have occurred and recognizing the excessive delay, Wells Fargo refuses to take responsibility. This ongoing denial is outrageous as anyone in the mortgage industry examining this knows the fault lies on XXXX XXXX and her team. \\n\\nCustomer Experience- I am unsure of why the issue of XXXX XXXX XXXX me false information about rate locking is listed under customer experience, but I will respond to it here. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX about the possibility of locking in a rate for my loan. At that time, I was unaware of XXXX 's restriction on discussing rates with clients, which was later brought to my attention by XXXX XXXX. My inquiry was prompted by the favorable rate of 6.9 % on that day. Based on federal lending laws, I should have been referred to XXXX XXXX and provided with a detailed loan estimate explaining my options for rate locking. However, none of that occurred and I was lead to believe false information. The information provided during my conversation with XXXX XXXX significantly influenced my decision-making process. I am disappointed by Wells Fargo 's characterization of this issue as \" she said vs she said, '' as I am prepared to testify under oath regarding the details of that conversation. I am unwilling to accept that there is no proof, so this is being thrown out as I have consistently brought this to the attention of many Wells Fargo employees and have been XXXX percent truthful. I would also like to know how Wells Fargo came to the amount of XXXX dollars and XXXX dollars?\n",
